[x] lazy evaluation
[ ] fix unique lambda members (each member should have its own argument x)
[ ] representation: find a good way to print numbers, strings
[ ] stackoverflow: use queue instead
[ ] memoryleaks: add Delete_NAME(ff) functions (simmilar to Init_NAME)
[ ] multithreading: consider evaluating each leaf at the same time
[ ] maybe use C instead of C++ (faster compile-time, maybe better optimisations)
[ ] code quality: rewrite everything in haskell
